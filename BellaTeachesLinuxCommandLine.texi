@node Linux Commands
@chapter Linux Commands
@cindex Linux Commands
@center @image{images/Bella-5,,180pt,Picture of Bella,jpg}
@section @command{whoami}
@cindex whoami
The command @command{whoami} prints your userid. At the Linux terminal type the command: @command{whoami}.
@*
@*
@c @image{images/command-whoami,13cm,2cm,Example of Linux command whoami,png}
@image{images/whoami,,37pt,Example of Linux command whoami,png}
@*
@*
Linux responds that ``bella'' is the userid. Your system should respond with your userid.

@section @command{pwd}
@cindex pwd
The command @command{pwd} is used to print the name of current working directory.
@*
@*
@c @image{images/commamd=pwd,11cm,1.75cm,Example of Linux command pwd,png}
@image{images/pwd,,38pt,Example of Linux command pwd,png}
@*
@*
Bella's current working directory is @file{/home/bella}. Therefore the @file{bella} directory is
inside the @file{home} directory. The first slash character @file{/} in the @file{/home/bella} directory name is known as the root directory.
The @file{home} directory is subdirectory of @file{root}. The @file{bella} directory is a subdirectory of @file{home}. All users of Linux have a directory in @file{/home}.
@*
@*
Linux has a hierarchical file system. The hierarchy starts with the root directory @file{/}. The structure of the file system looks like a tree. Inside the root directory @file{/} you will find files and subdirectories. The subdirectories can continue to have their own files or subdirectories. This structure can continue for many levels.

@section @command{ls}
@cindex ls
The command @command{ls} lists directory contents. Directories can also be called folders. At the Linux terminal type the command: @command{ls}.
@*
@*
@c @image{images/command-ls,15cm,2cm,Example of Linux command ls,png}
@image{images/ls,,37pt,Example of Linux command ls,png}
@*
@*
We see Bella has some directories. Your system should display something similar.
@*
@*
We can look inside an individual directory by giving command @command{ls} a specific
directory name to look in. Type the command: @command{ls Music}
@*
@*
@image{images/ls-Music,,47pt,Example of Linux command ls on Music directory,png}
@*
@*
Looks like Bella has no music since the @file{Music} directory is empty. When we type a command such as @command{ls Music} we say that @file{Music} is an argument to the command @command{ls}.
When we type the command @command{ls} alone we can say @command{ls} has no arguments.
@*
@*
We can check if Bella has any documents. Type the command: @command{ls Documents}
@*
@*
@image{images/ls-Music-Documents,,56pt,Example of Linux command ls on Documents directory,png}
@*
@*
The @file{Document} directory is empty. Bella has no documents.
@*
@*
@center @image{images/Bella-4,,180pt,Picture of Bella,jpg}
@*
@*
The command @command{ls} has the ability to match filenames using a wildcard. Try typing the command: @command{ls D*}
@*
@*
The asterik * or star character tells the command @command{ls} to match any string after the letter @file{D}. The contents of all directories begining with the letter @file{D} will be displayed.
@*
@*
@image{images/ls-wild-card,,83pt,Example of Linux command ls on Documents directory,png}
@*
@*
The directories @file{Desktop}, @file{Documents} and @file{Downloads} are all empty.
@*
@*
Use the command @command{ls} to explore the Linux filesystem. Type the command: @command{ls /}
@*
@*
@image{images/ls-root,,73pt,Example of Linux command ls on Documents directory,png}
@*
@*
This lists the contents of the @file{/} which is known as root.
@*
Type the command: @command{ls /home}
@*
@*
@image{images/ls-home,,41pt,Example of Linux command ls on Documents directory,png}
@*
@*
Bella's home directory shows another user. Your system may display other users.
@*
@*
The command @command{ls} can also take options (also called switches). The listing of the contents of all subdirectories can be done with the command: @command{ls -R}
@*
@*
The @command{-R} part of command tells @command{ls} to recursively list all subdirectories. Try typing the command: @command{ls -R}

@section @command{cd}
@cindex cd
The command @command{cd} changes your current working directory.
@*
@*
When the command @command{cd} is typed alone (with no arguments) the current working directory is changed to your home directory.
@*
@*
@image{images/cd-0,,27pt,Example of Linux command ls on Documents directory,png}
@*
@*
At the Linux terminal type the command: @command{cd Music}.
@*
@*
Now the current working directory has changed to the Music directory.
@*
@*
The command @command{ls} will display the contents of the @file{Music} directory.
@*
@*
@image{images/cd-Music-ls,,39pt,Example of Linux command ls on Documents directory,png}
@*
@*
The @file{Music} is empty.
@*
@*
The command @command{pwd} will display the full directory path.
@*
@*
@image{images/cd-Music-ls-pwd,,58pt,Example of Linux command ls on Documents directory,png}
@*
@*
@center @image{images/Bella-6,,180pt,Picture of Bella,jpg}
@*
@*
To pop up from the @file{Music} directory type the command: @command{cd ..}
@*
@*
@center @image{images/cd-dot-dot,,70pt,Picture of Bella,jpg}
@*
@*
Now the current working directory is one level above. To confirm this type the command: @command{ls}
@*
@*
@center @image{images/cd-dot-dot-ls,,89pt,Picture of Bella,jpg}
@*
@*
Typing the command @command{pwd} will confirm that the current working directory is back to the user's home directory.
@*
@*
@image{images/pwd,,37pt,Example of Linux command pwd,png}

@section @command{mkdir} and @command{rmdir}
@cindex mkdir
@cindex rmdir
When using the command @command{ls} we can see that Bella has the following folders in
her home directory.
@*
@*
@c @image{images/command-ls,15cm,2cm,Example of Linux command ls,png}
@image{images/ls,,37pt,Example of Linux command ls,png}
@*
@*
To create a directory named @file{Test} type the command: @command{mkdir Test}
@*
@*
@image{images/ls-mkdir-Test,,45pt,Example of Linux command ls,png}
@*
@*
Try typing the command: @command{ls} to confirm this directory was created.
You should see the directory @file{Test} listed with the other directories.
@*
@*
@image{images/ls-mkdir-Test-ls,,77pt,Example of Linux command ls,png}
@*
@*
To remove the directory named @file{Test} type the command: @command{rmdir Test}
@*
@*
@image{images/ls-mkdir-Test-ls-rmdir-Test,,85pt,Example of Linux command ls,png}
@*
@*
Type the command @command{ls} to confirm that the directory @file{Test} has been removed.
@*
@*
@c @image{images/command-ls,15cm,2cm,Example of Linux command ls,png}
@image{images/ls-mkdir-Test-ls-rmdir-Test-ls,,103pt,Example of Linux command ls,png}
@*
@*
@center @image{images/Bella-8,,180pt,Picture of Bella,jpg}

@section @command{echo} and @command{cat}
@cindex echo
@cindex cat
The command @command{echo} is used to write text to the screen. The command @command{echo} can also write text to a file. At the Linux terminal type the command: @command{echo}.
@*
@*
@image{images/echo,,37pt,Example of Linux command ls,png}
@*
@*
The command @command{echo} with no arguments will just display a blank line.
@*
Now try typing the command: @command{echo Hello}
@*
@*
@image{images/echo-echo-Hello,,56pt,Example of Linux command ls,png}
@*
@*
The text @file{Hello} will be displayed to the terminal. The command @command{echo} can also push text to a file.
@*
@*
Try typing the command: @command{echo "This is a test" > file.txt}
@*
@*
The greater-than sign @file{>} tells the command @command{echo} to redirect the output to the file. The output will @i{not} go to the display. 
@*
@*
@image{images/echo-echo-Hello-echo-file,,70pt,Example of Linux command ls,png}
@*
@*
The command @command{echo} has placed the text ``This is a test'' inside the @file{file.txt}.
@*
@*
We can confirm the file exists with the command @command{ls}
@*
@*
@image{images/echo-echo-Hello-echo-file-ls,,100pt,Example of Linux command ls,png}
@*
@*
Notice the new file @file{file.txt}. The contents of the file @file{file.txt} can be displayed with the command: @command{cat file.txt}. The command @command{cat} can concatenate files and print files on the display. The contents of the file is the text ``This is a test''.
@*
@*
@image{images/echo-echo-Hello-echo-file-ls-cat,,120pt,Example of Linux command ls,png}
@*
@*
@center @image{images/Bella-9,,180pt,Picture of Bella,jpg}

@section @command{cp} and @command{rm}
@cindex cp
@cindex rm
The command @command{cp} copies files and directories. The command @command{rm} removes files or directories.
@*
Create a file with the command: @command{echo "This is another test file" > TestFile.txt}
@*
@*
@image{images/echo-Test-File,,26pt,Example of Linux command ls,png}
@*
@*
Confirm the file exists with the command @command{ls} and confirm the file contents with the command @command{cat}.
@*
@*
@image{images/echo-Test-File-cat,,77pt,Example of Linux command ls,png}
@*
@*
Using the command @command{rm} delete the file with: @command{rm TestFile.txt}
@*
@*
@image{images/echo-Test-File-cat-rm,,85pt,Example of Linux command ls,png}
@*
@*
Now confirm the file was deleted with the command @command{ls}
@*
@*
@image{images/echo-Test-File-cat-rm-ls,,98pt,Example of Linux command ls,png}
@*
@*
@center @image{images/Bella-11,,180pt,Picture of Bella,jpg}
@*
@*
Create another file @file{NewTestFile.txt} with the command @command{echo}.
@*
Type the command: @command{echo "Test file to be copied" > NewTestFile.txt}
@*
@*
Confirm the file exists with the command @command{ls}. Confirm the contents with the command @command{cat}.
@*
@*
@center @image{images/cp-1,,70pt,Picture of Bella,jpg}
@*
@*
Copy the file @file{NewTestFile.txt} to the file @file{1.txt} with the command: @command{cp NewTestFile.txt 1.txt}
@*
@*
@image{images/cp-2,,77pt,Picture of Bella,jpg}
@*
@*
Copy the file @file{NewTestFile.txt} to the file @file{2.txt} with the command: @command{cp NewTestFile.txt 2.txt}

@*
Copy the file @file{NewTestFile.txt} to the file @file{3.txt} with the command: @command{cp NewTestFile.txt 3.txt}
@*
@*
@image{images/cp-4,,95pt,Picture of Bella,jpg}
@*
@*
Confirm the existance of the new files @file{1.txt}, @file{2.txt} and @file{3.txt} with the command: @command{ls}
@*
@*
@image{images/cp-5,,130pt,Picture of Bella,jpg}
@*
@*
Concatenate the files @file{1.txt}, @file{2.txt} and @file{3.txt} to the screen display with the command: @command{cat 1.txt 2.txt 3.txt}
@*
@*
@image{images/cp-6,,170pt,Picture of Bella,jpg}
@*
@*
All three files are displayed on the screen back to back. All three files have the same contents. Remove one of the files with the command: @command{rm 1.txt}
@*
@*
@image{images/cp-7,,170pt,Picture of Bella,jpg}
@*
@*
Using what is known as a wildcard have command @command{ls} check for files only ending with @file{.txt} file extension. Try typing the command: @command{ls *.txt}
@*
@*
@image{images/cp-8,,35pt,Picture of Bella,jpg}
@*
@*
Only files with the @file{.txt} file extension have been displayed. The file @file{1.txt} has been removed. Remove the files @file{2.txt} and @file{3.txt} with
the command command: @command{rm 2.txt 3.txt}
